<h2>NAME</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ski &minus; an
unusual skiing simulation game</p>

<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ski</b></p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Imagine you are
skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as trees,
ice, bare ground, and the Yeti, -- a horrible monster! Each
turn moves you one screen row downhill. Unfortunately, you
have to put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you
can&rsquo;t see ahead where you are going; only behind where
you have been.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, you
can turn to either side, jump or hop through the air,
teleport through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast
spells to call the Fire Demon. And since the hazards occur
in patches, you can skillfully out-maneuver them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You ski until
something bad happens to you. Your final score is based on
how far you have skiied, how many jumps you made, how many
Yetis have melted during your run, and how healthy you are
when are finished.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
characters represent the things that you see on the slope
behind you:</p>

<p>This is the Yeti! As soon as he crawls out of a Snobank,
he will lumber directly towards you at one space per turn,
and if he gets within one space of you, he will grab you and
beat you up! However, he has trouble moving through trees.
Steer clear from the Yeti, and he will melt after a while,
since it is a sunny day. If you jump over him, your
jet-powered skis will help melt him. You can also melt him
with nuclear ICBMs, or call the Fire Demon who will cook
him, but once a Yeti melts, another one always shows up
after a while. The Yeti doesn&rsquo;t understand about the
edges of the slope either, so you can just cross them to get
away from him! And since he is slower than you, you can try
to ski right past him before he can grab you!</p></td>

<p>This represents a nuclear ICBM that you launched. You
launch them from your backpack, and they zoom right at the
Yeti.</p> </td>

<p>This is the Fire Demon, who is always your friend unless
you call him a bad name and he gets mad at you.</p></td>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are your
commands. You can type any one of these letters when you
have the &quot;?&quot; prompt on the end of the slope line,
or just hit a return to do nothing this turn. Preceding any
command with a number does that command repeatedly; thus,
for example, &lsquo;&lsquo;4l&rsquo;&rsquo; is
&lsquo;&lsquo;turn left 4 times&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Turn to the right.
If you were going straight down, this will make you go one
space to the right every turn. If you type &quot;R&quot;
again, then you will go two spaces to the right every turn.
If you type &quot;L&quot; the next turn, you will again be
going one space to the right every turn. Remember that you
can&rsquo;t turn when you are on ice, and if you go off the
edge of the slope you come back into the other edge. You
travel farther while you are going sideways, so you get a
better score if you slalom to the side a lot, but you can
never go sideways more than five spaces per turn.</p></td>

totally opposite.</p></td>

<p>Jump. When jumping, you don&rsquo;t have the
&quot;?&quot; on the right for each line you jump over, so
you can&rsquo;t enter a command for it. You can&rsquo;t
fall, hit trees, or get grabbed by the Yeti while jumping,
but you might land badly and get hurt. Since the Yeti moves
one space toward you each turn, you have to be going at
least two spaces per turn sideways to jump over him without
getting grabbed when you land, but your jet-powered skis may
melt the Yeti while you&rsquo;re jumping over him.</p></td>

<p>Teleport through hyperspace. This transports you to
somewhere else on the slope, but you might materialize way
up in the air and fall down.</p></td>

<p>Launch ICBM with nuclear warhead. If your backpack is
working well, an ICBM will be launched from it towards the
Yeti, travelling at three spaces per turn. Launching ICBMs
is dangerous, but once one is going, it can&rsquo;t hurt
you. If it is launched and loses its negative-infrared lock
on the Yeti, it self-destructs.</p></td>

<p>Cast spell to summon the Fire Demon to this material
plane. If the alternate universes are in a synchronous
phase, the Fire Demon will appear somewhere on the slope,
and move to attack the Yeti at one space per turn, but if
something goes wrong while casting this spell, the Fire
Demon might get mad and decide to go for you instead of the
Yeti! If there is no Yeti around, the Fire Demon will soon
get bored and go home. If you don&rsquo;t like where the
Fire Demon showed up, you can try to recast this spell, so
that he will appear somewhere else.</p></td>

<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Spawn an invisible monster called a UNIX shell. You may
type to the shell; it will do strange things with your
input, opening a space warp in the middle of the ski-slope
to display them at you. The shell monster is polite; when it
is done, you will be deposited back on your slope exactly
where you were before.</p></td>
