        <h3>ski, a fun and silly game</h3>
        <p>Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards
        as trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti!  Unfortunately,
        you have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see ahead
        where you are going; only behind where you have been.  However, you can
        turn to either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport through
        hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the Fire
        Demon.  And since the hazards occur in patches, you can skillfully
        outmaneuver them.  A fun and very silly game that proves you don't need
        fancy graphical user interfaces to have a good time.</p>
        <p>This is a JavaScript reimplementation of the Python reimplementation
        of a C game from 1990, with on-line help added.  The original was by
        Mark Stevans, this implementation is released under open-source terms
        by Eric S. Raymond.</p>
        <p>The internals of this game are actually kind of interesting.  The
        terrain generator is a simple cellular automaton that generates crude
        2D fractals.</p>
        <p>See <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/ski/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/ski/</a>
        for updates and related resources.</p>
        <p>This has been ported over to JavaScript by Devin Weaver using the
        jQuery library. This can easily be added to any website as a stand
        alown or as an easter egg embedded into a div. (See the
        <a href="easteregg.html">easter egg example</a>)</p>
        <p>See the
        <a href="http://github.com/sukima/skiQuery">project page</a> for
        the latest information concerning bugs and news.</p>
